# IOS - 1. project: bash script
One of the projects I did for my Operating Systems class in my second semester at Brno University of Technology. The whole project is basically a big bash script, which is feeded CSV files with data about COVID infections in the Czech Republic and then produces desired output based on the chosen command and flag. The whole code is a mess (mainly the awk statements), because at the end, I got too tired to make the code clear, but it works (almost) as intended.
